# Undertale Yellow Randomizer Setup Guide

### Required Software

- Undertale Yellow AP Version from the Release GitHub
- Archipelago from the [Archipelago Releases Page](https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago/releases)

### First time setup
If you downloaded the mod from the GitHub, you should already be good to go.
Just generate a seed, connect the client, boot the game up and start playing!

**Linux Users**: For Linux users, however, I have not been able to test it. You will need to run the
game from Proton or Wine as this is built off the Windows version. You may also need to redirect the client
to the correct save file directory using `/savepath` command. The save is located in `*/users/USERNAME/Appdata/local/Undertale_Yellow`,
with I believe that first part depending on what you use to run the game.

### Bug Reporting
The game is new and this is my first mod, so if there are any bugs or logic errors please please please report them to me. This can be done
through Discord DM (Username: Pugie38), or through the Undertale Yellow thread in the Archipelago Unoffical Server.
