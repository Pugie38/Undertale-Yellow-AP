# Undertale Yellow

## Where's my yaml?
A template yaml can be generated using the `Generate Template Yamls` option in the Archipelago Launcher.
One may also be optioned from the mods GitHub page.

## What are locations?
All items you pick up the ground, LOVE and Stat increases (if enabled), shops, and boss completions (barring final bosses) are checks.

For boss checks, Martlet, El Balidor, and Axis are both a Pacifist/Neutral version and a Genocide version. Starlo and Guardener are not fought on Genoicde, Ceroba (Genocide) is not fought on Pacifist/Neutral.

Be vigilant- there are alot more route specific checks than in Undertale.

## What happens when I get an item?
The game will check to see if you have space in your inventory.
If you do, the game puts the item in there. Unlike Undertale, however, if you dont the game will instead put the item into the Dimensional Bag.

## How do I win?
The goal is to beat the final boss of the chosen route and reach the credits.
### Pacifist
Victory will be awarded either when Clover says "It's time to go." or when the Asgore fight begins.
### Neutral
Victory will be awarded when Flowey begins his monologue after the fight ends.
### Genocide
Victory will be awarded when Clover goes through the Barrier with the 5 Human Souls.
## Items required to goal
- All routes require Hotland Key, Left UG Apartment Roof Pass, and Right UG Apartment Roof Pass.
- Pacifist also needs to watch Chujin's Tapes, meaning they also need Steamworks Key and Dunes Key.
- Genocide, if LOVE rando or Stats Rando is enabled, needs 18 HP/ATK Ups or 18 LOVE depending on settings.
If both are disabled, they instead need Dunes Key, Steamworks Key, and the Hydrochloric Acid to get to a high enough level.
## What else is different?
- There are warp doors going to each area in a new hub room, and infinite supply of both gold and healing items in there as well to make sure nobody gets stuck.
- You can warp back to the HUB Room at any save point using the new Warp option.
- Genocide Blockers now exist in every area that prevent you from moving forwards until the kill count is achieved.
- There is a Mail Whale in the HUB who will take you to any Mail Station you have been to before on that save file.
- Both traveling with Mail Whale and the Dimensional Bag are activated at the start.
- The Wild East has been significantly shortened to fit better in a randomizer setting.
- Several other QoL improvements

## Client Commands
There are a few commands that you can use in the Undertale Yellow Client
- `/resync` Manually trigger a resync.
- `/savepath` Redirect to proper save data folder. This is necessary for Linux users to use before connecting.
- `/deathlink` Toggles deathlink

## Special Thanks
I want to give a special thanks to Mewlif as I used their implementation of Undertale AP as a baseline and without that it would've taken me ALOT longer to actually learn what I needed to do.
